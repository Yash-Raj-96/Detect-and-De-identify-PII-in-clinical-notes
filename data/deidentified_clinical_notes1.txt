There is associated compressive atelectasis. Thevisualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.There is no pericardial effusion. There is a [REDACTED]-mmhypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of theliver [REDACTED_ID] too small to accurately characterize butstatistically most likely representing a cyst. There arebilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normalin size. There is a [REDACTED]-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreaticbody, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder andadrenal glands are unremarkable. An [REDACTED_ORG] tube terminates in thestomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loopsappear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oralcontrast material has passed into the ascending colon withoutevidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,tracking over a distance of approximately [REDACTED] cm.CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST The pelvic small and large bowel[REDACTED_NAME], collapsed bladder containing [REDACTED_NAME] catheter and seminalvesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,measuring [REDACTED].[REDACTED] cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains amoderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or freefluid.BONE WINDOWS No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There isDISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There alsoare degenerative changes about the hip joints with largeacetabular osteophytes.[REDACTED_ORG][REDACTED]. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.[REDACTED]. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle withassociated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air [REDACTED_ID]. Noassociated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlateclinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.injections.[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This couldrepresent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for furtherevaluation.[REDACTED]. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, toosmall to accurately characterize.[REDACTED]. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.[REDACTED]. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussedby Dr. First Name STitle [REDACTED_ID] Name STitle [REDACTED_ID] with Dr. First Name STitle [REDACTED_ID] at [REDACTED_ID] p.m. on [REDACTED_DATE].[REDACTED_DATE]VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS Real-time videofluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administrationof thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with thespeech pathologist.ORAL PHASE Normal bolus formation, bolus control, [REDACTED_ORG] tonguemovement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.PHARYNGEAL PHASE There is normal swallow initiation and velarelevation.

[REDACTED_DATE] anteriorcervical decompressionfusion at C6-[REDACTED]. [REDACTED_DATE] Cervicallaminectomy C6-C7  T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesisC4-T1. He tolerated the procedures well. He was extubatedwithout complication.After his surgical procedures, Mr. [REDACTED_NAME] lastname [REDACTED_ID] was transferedto the medicine service at Hospital1 [REDACTED] for his medical care. While onthe medicine service, patient was found to be persistentlyaspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. Patientand family were not interested in an [REDACTED_LOCATION] tube or [REDACTED_ORG] fornutrition. Patient also developed a venous clot of the rightupper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed withmedical treatment. Goals of care were changed to comfortmeasures only. A [REDACTED_NAME] was placed after patient had difficultywith urinary retention and straight cathing. A palliative careconsult was obtained for symptom management and patient wasdischarged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley inplace for symptomatic relief.Medications on Admission[REDACTED_NAME]seroqueldocusatemetoprololfolate[REDACTED_NAME]captoprilASAipratroium inhalerFerrous sulfatefurosemidecitalopramisosorbidemeprazole[REDACTED_NAME][REDACTED].
